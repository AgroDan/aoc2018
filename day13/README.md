# Day 13: Mine Cart Madness

I was excited to finally work with a pathfinding challenge...sorta. Granted this "pathfinding" was mostly...well, _literally_ on rails, as each minecart was destined to follow its specific path and the only real "pathfinding" was the predefined condition of how to handle intersections, that each cart has its own set of instructions in its own order and when it hits an intersection it will determine if it turns right, left, or just goes straight. Setting this up was relatively simple as I just created a `*Cart{}` object with this info and a few helper functions that allowed it to determine what direction "turning right" actually means, IE if facing `East`, turning right means now facing `South`. I used the `aocutils` module I wrote to specifically use the enumerated values for those directions so it could work properly.

The problem I ran into in the first place was that I didn't realize that the _order_ of the carts was specified. I just let them all go, but really I was supposed to move them in the order of closest to the top left part of the map, ending with the closest to the bottom right. That tripped me up quite a bit. Once I got that down and answered part 1, Part 2 was pretty simple. Just ditch the carts once they crash, then print out the location of the last cart. Not even much of a computationally difficult application, just let it keep going. Finished in `511.1011ms`.
