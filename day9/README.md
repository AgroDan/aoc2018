# Day 9: Marble Mania

This questions was mercifully easy. Admittedly though, it took me a fair amount of time to really grok the challenge here. The game was weird, adding marbles to a circle and only adding to your score if the marble you add is a multiple of `23`. Seems like there isn't any skill there, just whoever happens to be sitting in the right place of the circle. Though in a weird way, this game is a weirder representation of [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz), so my first thought was to just loop through it all and be done with it. But...I dunno, just looking at the data presented as the challenge and how it seemed to keep referencing the fact that the marbles were in a circle...I just knew it could be represented as a [Circular Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list). It's rare when I get to use it, but when I do I'd say that this is almost as satisfying as a nice efficient Recursive Function.

Luckily I chose correctly, because when Part 1 was completed using this method, Part 2's rug-pull was the ol' "okay same challenge, just with a much bigger number" bit. Didn't matter, part 2 was a trivial addition. Just had to export the `Marbles` variable in the `Game{}` object so I could multiply it by 100 and it crunched through both games is `349.4832ms`. I can live with those numbers!
